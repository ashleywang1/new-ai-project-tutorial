# Phase 0: Setup - Foundation Layer

**@fileoverview** Initial setup phase establishing a barebones but functional foundation with basic Go API server, Docker containerization, and minimal ClickHouse connectivity.

---

## Objectives

Establish a minimal running system that demonstrates core architectural components without full functionality. This phase creates the foundation for all subsequent development.

**Deliverables:**
- Basic Go API server with health endpoints
- Docker containerization with multi-architecture builds
- ClickHouse connection and basic query capability
- Minimal gRPC service definitions
- Basic project structure following AI-first principles

## Features & Tasks

### 1. Project Scaffolding & Go Foundation
**Goal:** Create properly structured Go project with health endpoints
- [ ] Initialize Go module with proper directory structure (`cmd/`, `pkg/`, `proto/`)
- [ ] Implement basic HTTP server with `/health` and `/ready` endpoints  
- [ ] Add structured logging with correlation IDs
- [ ] Create Makefile for build automation
- [ ] Setup basic error handling and graceful shutdown

### 2. Docker Containerization  
**Goal:** Package application as multi-architecture container
- [ ] Create multi-stage Dockerfile optimized for Go builds
- [ ] Implement build pipeline supporting amd64/arm64 architectures
- [ ] Add container health checks and proper signal handling
- [ ] Create `.dockerignore` for optimized build context
- [ ] Test container runs locally with basic functionality

### 3. ClickHouse Integration Foundation
**Goal:** Establish basic database connectivity and query execution
- [ ] Implement ClickHouse client with connection pooling
- [ ] Create basic query builder for simple SELECT operations
- [ ] Add database health check integration
- [ ] Implement connection retry logic with exponential backoff
- [ ] Test basic query execution against sample ClickHouse instance

### 4. gRPC Service Skeleton
**Goal:** Define basic gRPC contracts and generate code
- [ ] Create proto definitions for core services (metrics, traces, crds, query)
- [ ] Setup `buf.build` for protocol buffer management
- [ ] Generate Go gRPC stubs and basic server implementation
- [ ] Implement placeholder handlers returning mock data
- [ ] Add gRPC health checking service

### 5. Development Tooling Setup
**Goal:** Establish development environment and code quality tools
- [ ] Configure VS Code workspace with Go extensions and settings
- [ ] Setup pre-commit hooks for formatting and basic linting
- [ ] Create development Docker Compose for ClickHouse testing
- [ ] Add basic unit test structure with table-driven tests
- [ ] Document local development setup in README

---

## Success Criteria

- [x] **Runnable Binary**: `go run cmd/apiserver/main.go` starts server successfully
- [x] **Health Endpoints**: `/health` returns 200, `/ready` validates ClickHouse connection
- [x] **Container Builds**: `docker build` creates working multi-arch images
- [x] **ClickHouse Connection**: Server connects to ClickHouse and executes basic queries
- [x] **gRPC Services**: Basic gRPC endpoints respond with placeholder data
- [x] **Code Quality**: All files under 500 lines, proper `@fileoverview` documentation

```

### Key Dependencies
- `google.golang.org/grpc` - gRPC server and client
- `github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-go/v2` - ClickHouse driver
- `github.com/sirupsen/logrus` - Structured logging
- `github.com/spf13/viper` - Configuration management

### Configuration Requirements
- ClickHouse connection string (host, port, database, credentials)
- Server port configuration (HTTP and gRPC)
- Log level and format settings
- Health check intervals and timeouts

## Next Phase Preview

Phase 1 (MVP) will build upon this foundation by:
- Implementing real metrics, traces, and CRD endpoints with ClickHouse queries
- Adding React frontend with basic UI components
- Creating Helm chart for Kubernetes deployment
- Integrating basic authentication and RBAC
